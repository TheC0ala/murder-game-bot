# murder-game-bot
A Telegram bot for playing  "MÃ¶rderspiel" - murder game


The game is for a group of people in a physical environment, and can be used to get to know each other. Every participating player is a murderer with the goal to kill a specific target, another player. How this happens depends on your specific game rules, but it usually involves physically handing over an item to the target. 
This bot aims to improve the game experience by making sheets of paper with names written on obsolete.

As a player some useful commands may be:
/kill Notify the bot that you killed your target. This has to be confirmed by the target by pressing
/dead.
You can see your target at any point with /target.
